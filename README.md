# Fermat’s Last Theorem
## Assignment 1
### Zachariah Kennedy and Chris Martinez

## Background

 The 17th century mathematician Pierre Fermat’s last theorem states that there are no natural numbers (1, 2, 3,…) x, y, and z such that x^n + y^n = z^n, in which n is a natural number greater than 2. Centuries later, the English mathematician Andrew Wiles published a proof of Fermat’s last theorem in 1995, a proof that is generally believed to be correct.
